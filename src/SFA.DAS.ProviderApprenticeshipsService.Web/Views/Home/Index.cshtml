        <p>This service is for training providers registered with the apprenticeship service to work with employers to:</p>
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
            <li>add details of the apprentices they're going to train</li>
            <li>manage details of the apprentices they're currently training</li>
        </ul>
     
        <h2 class="heading-medium">Before you start</h2>
        <p>You need to have an account with the government’s Information Management Services system (IdAMS) to use this.</p>
        <p>If your organisation doesn't already have an IdAMS account, you’ll get your account details when you <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-of-apprenticeship-training-providers" target="_blank" rel="external">register as an apprenticeship training provider</a>.</p>
        <p>If your organisation does already have an IdAMS account, an account super user from your organisation will need to give you access to the apprenticeship service.</p>
